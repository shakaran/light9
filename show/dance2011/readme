leftover software todo from last year:

OK vidref should have a time slider
OK factor out music dir so it can be different per machine
- all settings should be in RDF and live-shared across all apps, maybe with anzo for updates
- asco should have GUI for picking which sound output you want, and store the setting
- vidref should have snapshot button for taking pics of the stage
- bring mini tripod or beanbag for the vidref camera
- more remote contol stuff
- vidref adjustable crop to the stage aspect
- vidref should have an 'in progress' row to prove that it's recording something new
- remote-run GUIs should say what machine they're on. Or, everyone should say what RDF server it's talking tox
- scrub inside curvecalc, preview a video in it
- bring curvecalc's logging inside the GUI window
- asco stops considerably after the autostop time (according to curvecalc)
- vidref's replay 'enabled' button should be completely sticky across sessions
- audio process pipeline; RDF graph should track versions of songs (padded, normalized)

- subcomposter needs refresh
