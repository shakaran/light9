preshow:

test sliders on plus

copy past PHS lighting config to dance2008

make up/bow/down curves for all songs

OK make music curves

test camera on plus for taking stage pics; do a program to turn on
each channel and sub and get a picture. mix the order and do it fast,
so the camera doesn't get to readjust between them? 

OK setup patched mpd on plus and score

OK test mouse on plus

ext monitor on plus. score too?

buy LCDs

test lightsim running at the same time as curvecalc

test dmx output on 64-bit plus

OK fix showcofnig.py to search .mpdconf then /etc/mpd

normalize levels

apparently in 2007 we played music on the laptop 'score', and it was a
little bit messed up. Preloading into memory may have helped.

port togl to pyglet, perhaps?

map some buttons to the worklights, etc. Maybe midi board buttons? keypad? wii?

ramdisk for the preload

test local net

curvecalc slider instructions please


packing list:
  power strips
  computers, bcf, dmx
  net hub and cables
  dmx cables

issues to note during the show:

 who ran dmx:
 who ran music:
 who ran curvecalc:

 music stutters?

 light flickers?


next time:

  does avahi make the host-finding stuff easy? probably not worth
  much, but at least the host settings should be in config.n3

  rename :showPath to something about mpd

  right amount of connection logging on asco. it doesn't error clearly
  when it's looking for mpd on the wrong host
