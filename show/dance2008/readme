preshow:

OK test sliders on plus

OK copy past PHS lighting config to dance2008

OK make up/bow/down curves for all songs

OK make music curves

test camera on plus for taking stage pics; do a program to turn on
each channel and sub and get a picture. mix the order and do it fast,
so the camera doesn't get to readjust between them? 

OK setup patched mpd on plus and score

OK test mouse on plus

ext monitor on plus. score too?

buy LCDs

test lightsim running at the same time as curvecalc

test dmx output on 64-bit plus

OK fix showcofnig.py to search .mpdconf then /etc/mpd

OK normalize levels

apparently in 2007 we played music on the laptop 'score', and it was a
little bit messed up. Preloading into memory may have helped.

port togl to pyglet, perhaps?

map some buttons to the worklights, etc. Maybe midi board buttons? keypad? wii?

ramdisk for the preload

OK test local net

curvecalc slider instructions please


thurs:
  OK patches
  OK subs for each song
  OK fade curves per song

 music stutters? 

 light flickers?

 better sound cables

 keys


next time:

  does avahi make the host-finding stuff easy? probably not worth
  much, but at least the host settings should be in config.n3

  rename :showPath to something about mpd

  right amount of connection logging on asco. it doesn't error clearly
  when it's looking for mpd on the wrong host

  how to make initial subterms:
     light9% for x ({2..17}) { perl -lpe 's/song1/song'$x'/g' show/dance2008/subterms/song1.n3 > show/dance2008/subterms/song$x.n3 }

  how to normalize audio:
     plus(pts/0):~/projects/light9/show/dance2008/music/norm% normalize-audio -v --mix *.wav

  keys on curvecalc that jump to the "create new X" boxes

  share all data from all tools, no more refreshes or restarts

  bug where empty sub doesn't save from SC

  in KC, exclude house lights from being saved in any subs. But
  really, there should be another program for aux stuff like house
  lights.

  bring 500W bulbs, wire strippers

  record-everything mode that makes curves out of whatever happens on stage

  asco makes lots of errors after you play through the last song

  five second post

  KC should have a separate window that repeats the names of the subs
  in the current row, numbered as hardware sliders. This would be put
  on the screen where it's always visible, when KC is hidden

  subterms on nonexistent subs are getting lost, but i need those for
  chase and effects

OK  subcomposer should save its geometry

  how to reset the dmx channels on a dimmer pack: [dmx] [erase] [clear]

  make a program to test chases

OK  curvecalc should always start up zoomed-out

  need curve delete button. show on each curve whether it's in use
  anywhere. let me hide a music curve if i'm low on space.

  ascoltami should learn to adjust volumes

  unnamed subterm is serious. i think only the last one created gets
  saved, or something

OK  KC smaller font on labels should allow bigger sliders

  curvecalc_all_subterms needs redo

  touched dmx cable; ~/dmxcrash in dmesg; process went to 'D' status; rebooted

  a nice startup would be: take a cd, boot up our OS image, make a new
  show from the cd tracks, UI for naming the channel numbers. 

  bring gaffer's tape
