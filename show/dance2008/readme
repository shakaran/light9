make music curves

test camera on plus for taking stage pics; do a program to turn on
each channel and sub and get a picture. mix the order and do it fast,
so the camera doesn't get to readjust between them? 

setup patched mpd on plus and score

test mouse on plus

ext monitor on plus. score too?

buy LCDs

test lightsim running at the same time as curvecalc

test dmx output on 64-bit plus

OK fix showcofnig.py to search .mpdconf then /etc/mpd

apparently in 2007 we played music on the laptop 'score', and it was a
little bit messed up. Preloading into memory may have helped.
