for local testing on plus:

sudo -u mpd -s
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/drewp/score
./mpd --no-daemon

fix networking.py to look for player on plus

PYTHONPATH=../pympd bin/ascoltami --show http://light9.bigasterisk.com/show/dance2010

plus(pts/3):~/projects/light9% bin/dmxserver -n

vidref
grab time from asco
always record picture against {songuri}/vid/{take}/{songtime}, so we never miss a recording (but at night when they're all gone, we don't need any recordings?)
play prev videos
let me tag a good rehearsal or toss junk rehearsals. if we juggle the playback time too much, you can be sure it's not a good pass
qt window with one live pane and any number of synced playback panes.
Do we need to detach from current song+time to view something else?
curvecalc should be able to fetch a sample of a lit frame to stick in its timeline
need to move curvecalc to qt?
can i dynamically change the output filename of a filesink? that might be the way to steer the ouptut correctly. But, i might want to append one take's frames into one file. Maybe use a standard compressor like mjpeg, and separately map the in-movie timestamp to our playback timestamp in case they drift.
new take for every single restart? i guess so, since they could pass over the same song time.
get twisted qt wrapper for our networking

show is 70min of music: at 8fps and 50k/pic, 1.6MB of image data per pass.


todo:
- check if mpd has a working precise-time system yet, so we could get off the patched one
