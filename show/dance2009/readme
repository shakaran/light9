    curvecalc corrupts its own save when subterm refers to nonexistent sub

    make trapezoids for all songs initially
        bows and songN

    delete curves, subterms inside curvecalc

OK  fix curvecalc 'collapsed' button

    when dragging points, don't crush the 0 and 1 values


curve status:
        general: faster fades at end?

        song1 done

        song2 needs work
            blue intro, fade to normal song
            95s new look?
            118s new look?

        song3 good enough
            could do something for costume change

        song4 check with choreo
            should be a more different look than song3?

            ramp in fade needs work

        song5 good enough

        song6 needs work
        OK  start with center look then grow
                check with choreo -- might be okay
        >>> fade lights when they lie down (drop to green)
                hard -- needs choreo
                no time to do

        OK  maybe gets strobe?

        song7 needs check
        OK  after trumpets slow fade to different look?
        OK  change before hernando
        ok? just red+orange for kicks (231)

        song8 maybe done! :)
            need better opening part
            can do without choreo

            flashing cyc during drum solo?

        song9 needs check
            needs check of xfade ~195
            
        song10 needs work, but no choreo
        ok? opens with SL, C, SR
            happens again at 100?, 145? -- cleanup timing
            also cleanup timing at end

        song11 needs work but no choreo
            chase in between "tequilas"?
            fade after first teq late
            44, 47 needs something
                and the teq right after it sucks

        song12 might be fine
            add narrowfront on the bigger cast

        song13 lookin' good!
        OK  blacklight?
        OK  gong change?

        song14 needs check
            different colors around 310?

            320 looked weird, sudden light change?

        song15 lookin' good!
            OK    cyc after song change? (120) too quick
            OK    chase/flashing after 2nd song change?

CRIT    song16 ..........?

120 V form
132 strobe on cartwheels

290 up/down rows
300 siren red and all colors
346 4 clusters
375 center circle
390 down ctr
399 up
403 jump in the center circle
410 build more flashing thing
431 staggered standup (still ctr)


        song17 might be fine
        >>  fade in: flashing with music

        OK  class change (~50s, ~90s, ~120s) should get color change
        OK  trapezoids are totally off
        OK  150 patios in

        >>  check timing, chase

next year:
    easy switch to booth speakers for testing sound without broadcasting?
    chase should be able to take subs and channels
OK  mute for curves in curvecalc
    get 2nd sliderboard, leave it on KC
    curvecalc disable slider output for reading input better
    add silence to songs instead of silence bookend sounds?
    be able to mute sliders
